    <p class="content-group">FullCalendar is a jQuery plugin that provides a full-sized, drag &amp; drop event calendar like the one below. It uses AJAX to fetch events on-the-fly and is easily configured to use your own feed format. It is visually customizable with a rich API. Example below demonstrates a default view of the calendar with a basic setup: draggable and editable events, and starting date.</p>
